# Colour Love

### Welcome to my personal project, Colour Love! This project includes:
- My first time working with databases! This was self-taught, and not as clean as it could be now that I've taken some database classes and learned more about REST APIs
- Goofy/interactive login and registration system
- Options to be surprised by a random 4-colour palette, or a slightly less randomized 4-colour palette that falls in the Red, Blue, or Green range
- User can click to copy the colour hex as well as save the generated palette for later use 

### The stack used: TypeScript, CSS, HTML, React, Redux, MySQL

### The way I brag about this site on my resume is as follows:
- Designed a responsive CRUD application with Vite and React, ensuring visual appeal and usability.
- Integrated Redux for efficient state management and user authentication by centralizing the application state. 
- Successfully configured and administered MySQL database servers to facilitate a seamless login/registration system and to store palettes for future use, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
